# P11.1 Design

## Methods

### `Demo`

- `main`: Does everything. Since there isn't really much, it doesn't make sense to incur the overhead of breaking the logic out into multiple methods/classes.

## Public interface

```java
// Demo
public static void main(String[] args);
```

## Instance variables

```java
// None
```
